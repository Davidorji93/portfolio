        I believe, any engineer should be able to understand the requirements, deliver on time, deliver according to the requirements. With David we have found out that  he  can provide all three. Itâ€™s a great team with excellent communication skills that made a difference in our business.

        David has impressed me with his attention to how the business is supposed to work and how the user experience he suggest aligns with our strategic goals. Our communication started with elaborate interviews that synchronized our vision. Once it came to design, he delivered stellar results and always contributed their own expertise to the final product. I am happy to work with David and would recommend him for challenging design and business analysis projects.
